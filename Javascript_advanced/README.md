# JavaScript Advanced

Welcome to the JavaScript Advanced learning project! This project is designed to deepen your understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts such as lexical scoping, closures, execution stack, binding, and callbacks.

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand lexical scoping in JavaScript.
- Learn about closures and their applications.
- Explore the execution stack and its order.
- Master the usage of binding.
- Understand the concept and usage of callbacks.

## Requirements:
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Code files should use the `.js` extension.

## Tasks:

1. **Lexical Scoping and Welcome Message**
   - Demonstrate lexical scoping.
   - Implement a welcome message function.

2. **Closure Scope Chain**
   - Explore the scope chain in closures.

3. **Closure**
   - Implement a closure function.

4. **Closure and Loops**
   - Demonstrate closures within loops.

5. **Complex Closure**
   - Implement a complex closure scenario.

6. **Changing DOM with Closure**
   - Use closures to manipulate the DOM.

7. **Private Methods with Closure**
   - Simulate private methods using closure.

8. **Stack Order and setTimeout**
   - Understand the execution stack order.
   - Explore `setTimeout`.

9. **Stack Order in Functions**
   - Demonstrate the execution stack order with nested functions.

10. **Prime Numbers & Timing Execution**
    - Calculate prime numbers.
    - Measure execution time.

11. **Execution Stack & Timing Execution**
    - Understand execution stack.
